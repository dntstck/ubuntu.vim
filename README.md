## About The Project

Provide a detailed description of your project. Explain the problem it solves, why you built it, and what it aims to achieve.

### Built With

List the major frameworks/libraries used in your project. For example:

- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.org/)
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Getting Started

Instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

List any software or tools that are necessary before installing the project. For example:

- npm
  ```bash
  npm install npm@latest -g

## Installation

Step-by-step instructions for installing and setting up your project. For example:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dntstck/projectname.git
2. etc

To get started with the project, the first step is to clone the repository from GitHub. This can be done by running the git clone command followed by the repository URL. Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory using the cd command. Before running the project, you need to install all the necessary dependencies. This is accomplished by running npm install, which reads the package.json file and installs all the listed dependencies. Ensure that you have npm installed on your system before attempting this step. These steps set up your project locally, allowing you to begin development or run the application.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start using it by running the application. Typically, this is done by executing npm start in your terminal, which launches the application and makes it accessible via a web browser or a local host. If the project includes tests, you can run them using npm test. Testing is crucial as it ensures that your application runs as expected and helps identify any issues. Make sure to follow the specific usage instructions provided, which might include details on user authentication, configuration settings, or command-line arguments that need to be passed.

## Features

This section highlights the core functionalities and features of your project. For instance, if your project includes user authentication, real-time chat capabilities, a responsive design, or a RESTful API, these would be detailed here. This gives users a quick overview of what your project offers and can help them understand the potential use cases. Each feature should be described concisely, focusing on its purpose and how it enhances the project.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for additional sensor types (e.g., CO2, noise levels)
- [ ] Implement user authentication and role-based access control
- [ ] Develop mobile application for iOS and Android
- [ ] Integrate with third-party APIs for additional data sources
- [ ] Enhance data visualization capabilities with more graph types
